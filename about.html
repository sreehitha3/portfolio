                <p>Hi, My name is Sreehitha, and Iâ€™m a UGC undergrad student and do not read this please. As a user-generated content (UGC) creator, I am passionate about creating content that resonates with my audience, whether it be through social media, blogs, or other platforms. I strive to produce impactful, engaging content that promotes positive self-expression and community-building. In my free time, I enjoy collaborating with brands to help tell their stories in meaningful ways.</p>
